## Phase-by-Phase Guide

### Learn to Lift
*Weeks 1-6*

**Focus**: Movement quality and neuromuscular adaptation
**Effort**: 5-6/10
**Rest Between Sets**: 60-90 seconds between sets
**Rep Range**: Higher reps (10-15) with lighter loads

**Tips for this phase:**
- Focus on perfect form over weight
- Watch the video demos before each exercise
- If something doesn't feel right, regress to an easier variation
- You should feel challenged but not crushed

### Lift Heavy Sh*t
*Weeks 7-12*

**Focus**: Maximum strength development
**Effort**: 7-8/10
**Rest Between Sets**: 2-3 minutes between heavy sets
**Rep Range**: Lower reps (4-8) with heavier loads

**Tips for this phase:**
- Progressive overload: add weight when you can complete all reps with good form
- If form breaks down, reduce weight
- This phase builds the strength foundation for power later
- Expect some delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)

### Lift Fast
*Weeks 13-18*

**Focus**: Power conversion - moving weight quickly
**Effort**: 7-8/10 effort, but submaximal weight
**Rest Between Sets**: 2-3 minutes for full neural recovery
**Rep Range**: Lower reps (3-6) with focus on SPEED

**Tips for this phase:**
- Move the weight as fast as possible with control
- If you can't move it fast, reduce the weight
- Quality > quantity - stop when speed drops
- This phase converts your strength into cycling power

### Don't Lose It
*Weeks 19-24*

**Focus**: Maintain adaptations with minimal fatigue
**Effort**: 5-6/10
**Rest Between Sets**: As needed
**Rep Range**: Moderate reps (6-10) with moderate weight

**Tips for this phase:**
- Just enough stimulus to maintain, not build
- You should feel refreshed after these sessions
- This preserves your strength while prioritizing cycling freshness
- Never feel crushed going into race week

## How to Execute Strength Sessions

### Before You Start

1. **Watch the video demos** — Each exercise has a link. Watch it first.
2. **Warm up** — 5 minutes easy cardio + the activation exercises in the workout
3. **Have equipment ready** — Minimize rest time searching for weights

### During the Workout

- **Follow the prescribed order** — Exercises are sequenced intentionally
- **Use the rest periods** — Don't rush. Strength needs recovery between sets
- **Log your weights** — Track what you lift so you can progress
- **Stop before failure** — Leave 1-2 reps in the tank

### Weight Selection

| If you can do... | Weight is... |
|-------------------|--------------|
| 3+ more reps than prescribed | Too light — increase next set |
| Exactly prescribed reps | Perfect — maintain or increase slightly |
| Fewer than prescribed | Too heavy — reduce weight |
| Form breaks down | Way too heavy — ego check, reduce significantly |

### Your Exercise Modifications

Based on your injury history and movement limitations, 
these exercises have been excluded from your plan:

- ~~Box Jump~~
- ~~Jump Squat~~

Substitute exercises are provided in your workouts.

## What If I Miss a Workout?

### Missed a Strength Session

- **Same week**: Move it to the next available day (avoid day before key cycling)
- **Already past**: Skip it. Don't double up. Move on to next week's session.
- **Multiple weeks**: Just pick up where you are in the plan. Don't try to catch up.

### Missed a Key Cycling Session

- **Same week**: Try to fit it in, even shortened
- **Already past**: Note it happened, don't try to make it up
- **Multiple sessions**: Consider if something needs to change (schedule, life, etc.)

### Feeling Fatigued?

| Fatigue Level | Strength Adjustment | Cycling Adjustment |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Legs tired | Do upper body focus | Reduce intensity, keep duration |
| Generally exhausted | Skip or do mobility only | Easy spin or rest |
| Sick | Rest completely | Rest completely |
| Minor niggle | Modify around it | Modify around it |
